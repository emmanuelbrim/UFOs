_Using dynamic tables to analyze data._


## Overview of the Project

An existing webpage created by a data journalist stores raw data on the web as a table and display information required by a user by accepting a date input and filtering the table to suit the input.
As part of enhancing the capabilites of this webpage, she wants to provide users with additional search criteria like city, state, country and shape that would filter the table at the same time and display the right information. 



## Results
The initial search form was expanded to now include fields for city, state, country and shape. Each field provide keys within the table for search.
A user can simply input his or her search item in the respective field and after pressing the Enter key the table on the page is filtered to display contents that match the search item.
The user can search by just one criteria or a combination to arrive at the desired results.


_Below is an example of the table filtered by state._

## Summary

### Drawback
The new design works perfect when the user has studied the table before searching. This is because the search item should match exactly what is in the table interms of case and white space if any.
This therefore is one drawback of the design.

### Recommendations
- The case sensitivity of the search inputs could be relaxed so that searches can adapt to both lower and upper case items as well as white spaces.
- The page can include a button to export the search results for printing or further analysis on a different platform.
